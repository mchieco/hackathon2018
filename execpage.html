                        States,</strong><br /> The President is both the head of state and head of government of the
                    United States of America, and Commander-in-Chief of the armed forces.
                    Under Article II of the Constitution, the President is responsible for the execution and
                    enforcement of the laws created by Congress. Fifteen executive departments — each led by an
                    appointed member of the President’s Cabinet — carry out the day-to-day administration of the
                    federal government. They are joined in this by other executive agencies such as the CIA and
                    Environmental Protection Agency, the heads of which are not part of the Cabinet, but who are under
                    the full authority of the President. The President also appoints the heads of more than 50
                    independent federal commissions, such as the Federal Reserve Board or the Securities and Exchange
                    Commission, as well as federal judges, ambassadors, and other federal offices. The Executive Office
                    of the President (EOP) consists of the immediate staff to the President, along with entities such
                    as the Office of Management and Budget and the Office of the United States Trade Representative.<br />

                    primary responsibility of the Vice President of the United States is to be ready at a moment’s
                    notice to assume the Presidency if the President is unable to perform his duties. This can be
                    because of the President’s death, resignation, or temporary incapacitation, or if the Vice
                    President and a majority of the Cabinet judge that the President is no longer able to discharge the
                    duties of the presidency.

                    The Vice President is elected along with the President by the Electoral College — each elector
                    casts one vote for President and another for Vice President. Before the ratification of the 12th
                    Amendment in 1804, electors only voted for President, and the person who received the second
                    greatest number of votes became Vice President. <br />

            <h2>Executive Office of the President</h2>
            <p>Every day, the President of the United States is faced with scores of decisions, each with important
                consequences for America&#8217;s future. To provide the President with the support that he or she needs to
                govern effectively, the Executive Office of the President (EOP) was created in 1939 by President Franklin D.
                Roosevelt. The EOP has responsibility for tasks ranging from communicating the President&#8217;s message to the
                American people to promoting our trade interests abroad.</p>
            <p>The EOP, overseen by the White House Chief of Staff, has traditionally been home to many of the
                President&#8217;s closest advisers. While Senate confirmation is required for some advisers, such as the
                Director of the Office of Management and Budget, most are appointed with full Presidential discretion. The
                individual offices that these advisors oversee have grown in size and number since the EOP was created. Some
                were formed by Congress, others as the President has needed them — they are constantly shifting as each
                President identifies his needs and priorities, with the current EOP employing over 1,800 people.</p>
            <p>Perhaps the most visible parts of the EOP are the White House Communications Office and Press Secretary&#8217;s
                Office. The Press Secretary provides daily briefings for the media on the President&#8217;s activities and
                agenda. Less visible to most Americans is the National Security Council, which advises the President on foreign
                policy, intelligence, and national security.</p>
            <p>There are also a number of offices responsible for the practicalities of maintaining the White House and
                providing logistical support for the President. These include the White House Military Office, which is
                responsible for services ranging from Air Force One to the dining facilities, and the Office of Presidential
                Advance, which prepares sites remote from the White House for the President&#8217;s arrival.</p>
            <p>Many senior advisors in the EOP work near the President in the West Wing of the White House. However, the
                majority of the staff is housed in the Eisenhower Executive Office Building, just a few steps away and part of
                the White House compound.</p>
            <h3>The Cabinet</h3>
            <p>The Cabinet is an advisory body made up of the heads of the 15 executive departments. Appointed by the President
                and confirmed by the Senate, the members of the Cabinet are often the President&#8217;s closest confidants. In
                addition to running major federal agencies, they play an important role in the Presidential line of succession
                — after the Vice President, Speaker of the House, and Senate President pro tempore, the line of succession
                continues with the Cabinet offices in the order in which the departments were created. All the members of the
                Cabinet take the title Secretary, excepting the head of the Justice Department, who is styled Attorney General.</p>
            <h4>Department of Agriculture</h4>
            <p>The U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) develops and executes policy on farming, agriculture, and food. Its
                aims include meeting the needs of farmers and ranchers, promoting agricultural trade and production, assuring
                food safety, protecting natural resources, fostering rural communities, and ending hunger in America and
                abroad.</p>
            <p>The USDA employs more than 100,000 employees and has an annual budget of approximately $95 billion. It consists
                of 17 agencies, including the Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service, the Food and Nutrition Service, and
                the Forest Service. The bulk of the department&#8217;s budget goes towards mandatory programs that provide
                services required by law, such as programs designed to provide nutrition assistance, promote agricultural
                exports, and conserve our environment.</p>
            <p>The USDA also plays an important role in overseas aid programs by providing surplus foods to developing
                countries.</p>
            <p>The United States Secretary of Agriculture administers the USDA.</p>
            <h4>Department of Commerce</h4>
            <p>The Department of Commerce is the government agency tasked with improving living standards for all Americans by
                promoting economic development and technological innovation.</p>

                and demographic data, issuing patents and trademarks, improving understanding of the environment and oceanic
                life, and ensuring the effective use of scientific and technical resources. The agency also formulates
                telecommunications and technology policy, and promotes U.S. exports by assisting and enforcing international
                trade agreements.</p>
            <p>The Secretary of Commerce oversees a $6.5 billion budget and approximately 38,000 employees.</p>
            <h4>Department of Defense</h4>
            <p>The mission of the Department of Defense (DOD) is to provide the military forces needed to deter war and to
                protect the security of our country. The department&#8217;s headquarters is at the Pentagon.</p>
            <p>The DOD consists of the Departments of the Army, Navy, and Air Force, as well as many agencies, offices, and
                commands, including the Joint Chiefs of Staff, the Pentagon Force Protection Agency, the National Security
                Agency, and the Defense Intelligence Agency. The DOD occupies the vast majority of the Pentagon building in
                Arlington, VA.</p>
            <p>The Department of Defense is the largest government agency, with more than 1.3 million men and women on active
                duty, nearly 700,000 civilian personnel, and 1.1 million citizens who serve in the National Guard and Reserve
                forces. Together, the military and civilian arms of DOD protect national interests through war-fighting,
                providing humanitarian aid, and performing peacekeeping and disaster relief services.</p>
            <h4>Department of Education</h4>
            <p>The mission of the Department of Education is to promote student achievement and preparation for competition in
                a global economy by fostering educational excellence and ensuring equal access to educational opportunity.</p>
            <p>The Department administers federal financial aid for education, collects data on America&#8217;s schools to
                guide improvements in education quality, and works to complement the efforts of state and local governments,
                parents, and students.<br />
                The U.S. Secretary of Education oversees the Department&#8217;s 4,200 employees and $68.6 billion budget.</p>
            <h4>Department of Energy</h4>
            <p>The mission of the Department of Energy (DOE) is to advance the national, economic, and energy security of the
                United States.</p>
            <p>The DOE promotes America&#8217;s energy security by encouraging the development of reliable, clean, and
                affordable energy. It administers federal funding for scientific research to further the goal of discovery and
                innovation — ensuring American economic competitiveness and improving the quality of life for Americans. The
                DOE is also tasked with ensuring America&#8217;s nuclear security, and with protecting the environment by
                providing a responsible resolution to the legacy of nuclear weapons production.</p>
            <p>The United States Secretary of Energy oversees a budget of approximately $23 billion and more than 100,000
                federal and contract employees.</p>
            <h4>Department of Health and Human Services</h4>
            <p>The Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) is the United States government&#8217;s principal agency for
                protecting the health of all Americans and providing essential human services, especially for those who are
                least able to help themselves. Agencies of HHS conduct health and social science research, work to prevent
                disease outbreaks, assure food and drug safety, and provide health insurance.</p>
            <p>In addition to administering Medicare and Medicaid, which together provide health insurance to one in four
                Americans, HHS also oversees the National Institutes of Health, the Food and Drug Administration, and the
                Centers for Disease Control.</p>
            <p>The Secretary of Health and Human Services oversees a budget of approximately $700 billion and approximately
                65,000 employees. The Department&#8217;s programs are administered by 11 operating divisions, including 8
                agencies in the U.S. Public Health Service and 3 human services agencies.</p>
            <h4>Department of Homeland Security</h4>
            <p>The missions of the Department of Homeland Security are to prevent and disrupt terrorist attacks; protect the
                American people, our critical infrastructure, and key resources; and respond to and recover from incidents that
                do occur. The third largest Cabinet department, DHS was established by the Homeland Security Act of 2002,
                largely in response to the terrorist attacks on September 11, 2001. The new department consolidated 22
                executive branch agencies, including the U.S. Customs Service, the U.S. Coast Guard, the U.S. Secret Service,
                the Transportation Security Administration, and the Federal Emergency Management Agency.<br />
                DHS employs 216,000 people in its mission to patrol borders, protect travelers and our transportation
                infrastructure, enforce immigration laws, and respond to disasters and emergencies.</p>
            <p>The agency also promotes preparedness and emergency prevention among citizens. Policy is coordinated by the
                Homeland Security Council at the White House, in cooperation with other defense and intelligence agencies, and
                led by the Assistant to the President for Homeland Security.</p>
            <h4>Department of Housing and Urban Development</h4>

                and programs that address America&#8217;s housing needs, that improve and develop the nation&#8217;s
                communities, and that enforce fair housing laws. The Department plays a major role in supporting homeownership
                for lower- and moderate-income families through its mortgage insurance and rent subsidy programs.</p>
            <p>Offices within HUD include the Federal Housing Administration, which provides mortgage and loan insurance; the
                Office of Fair Housing and Equal Opportunity, which ensures all Americans equal access to the housing of their
                choice; and the Community Development Block Grant Program, which helps communities with economic development,
                job opportunities, and housing rehabilitation. HUD also administers public housing and homeless assistance.</p>
            <p>The Secretary of Housing and Urban Development oversees approximately 9,000 employees on a budget of
                approximately $40 billion.</p>
            <h4>Department of the Interior</h4>

                Natives, and our responsibilities to island communities.</p>
            <p>DOI manages 500 million acres of surface land, or about one-fifth of the land in the United States, and manages
                hundreds of dams and reservoirs. Agencies within the DOI include the Bureau of Indian Affairs, the Minerals
                Management Service, and the U.S. Geological Survey. The DOI manages the national parks and is tasked with
                protecting endangered species.</p>
            <p>The Secretary of the Interior oversees about 70,000 employees and 200,000 volunteers on a budget of
                approximately $16 billion. Every year it raises billions in revenue from energy, mineral, grazing, and timber
                leases, as well as recreational permits and land sales.</p>

                Bureau of Investigation, the U.S. Marshals, and the Federal Bureau of Prisons. The Attorney General is the head
                of the DOJ and chief law enforcement officer of the federal government. The Attorney General represents the
                United States in legal matters, advises the President and the heads of the executive departments of the
                government, and occasionally appears in person before the Supreme Court.</p>
            <p>With a budget of approximately $25 billion, the DOJ is the world&#8217;s largest law office and the central
                agency for the enforcement of federal laws.</p>
            <h4>Department of Labor</h4>
            <p>The Department of Labor oversees federal programs for ensuring a strong American workforce. These programs
                address job training, safe working conditions, minimum hourly wage and overtime pay, employment discrimination,

            <p>The mission of the Department of Transportation (DOT) is to ensure a fast, safe, efficient, accessible and
                convenient transportation system that meets our vital national interests and enhances the quality of life of
                the American people.<br />

                such as the production of coin and currency, the disbursement of payments to the American public, the
                collection of taxes, and the borrowing of funds necessary to run the federal government. The Department works
                with other federal agencies, foreign governments, and international financial institutions to encourage global
                economic growth, raise standards of living, and, to the extent possible, predict and prevent economic and
                financial crises. The Treasury Department also performs a critical and far-reaching role in enhancing national
                security by improving the safeguards of our financial systems, implementing economic sanctions against foreign
                threats to the U.S., and identifying and targeting the financial support networks of national security threats.</p>

                Affairs became a cabinet-level department in 1989.</p>

                of hostility. About a quarter of the nation&#8217;s population — approximately 70 million people — are

                veterans.</p>
